        <header><h2>Why I prefer Dog over Cats</h2></header>
        <p>Dogs are simply just a better pet or even just a better animal because of how loyal they are to the people and other animals they love, know, and care about. Besides, Dogs are a man's best friend! We have domesticated dogs for over 30,000 years, they have hunted with us, solved problems, and have even gone to space with us. Dogs can be so much more productive than a cat as we can train k9's with helping disabled people, helping someone with anxiety, detecting dangerous events like seizures, and can even find and save people who are lost in whatever enviorment they have lost track of where they are in!</p>
